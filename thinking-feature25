Analyzing the attachment "snippet-XZJyPuK60E9ZH5RxVTfG60GumxDAlC.txt":
- It's an HTML file for a webpage showcasing a feature component labeled "feature25"
- Contains a navigation bar and a section for displaying different views (image, component, and code)
- The main content is a feature section with:
  1. A centered header with a badge, title, and description
  2. Three sections, each with a title and a 3-column grid of features
  3. Each feature is represented by a checkmark icon and text
  4. Sections are separated by horizontal dividers
- The component is built using Shadcn UI, React, and Tailwind CSS

Determining the appropriate response:
- The most suitable code block type is the React Component code block
- I need to recreate the main feature section as a functional React component
- The component should be styled with Tailwind CSS classes
- I should use Shadcn UI components where appropriate (e.g., Badge)
- The component should be responsive and accessible
- I must provide a complete, working code snippet without placeholders
