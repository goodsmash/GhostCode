<question>What is Partial Prerendering in Next.js?</question>
<answer>
Partial Prerendering (PPR) is an experimental feature introduced in Next.js 14 that aims to combine the benefits of static site generation and server-side rendering. Here are the key points about PPR:

1. Hybrid Rendering: PPR allows parts of a page to be prerendered (generated at build time) while other parts are rendered dynamically at request time.

2. Improved Performance: It enhances initial page load performance by serving a static shell immediately, then loading dynamic content as needed.

3. Seamless Integration: PPR works with existing Next.js features and requires minimal changes to your code.

4. Streaming: It leverages React's streaming capabilities to progressively render content.

5. Fallback Mechanism: If dynamic content fails to load, PPR provides a fallback UI to ensure a smooth user experience.

6. SEO Benefits: The prerendered content is immediately available to search engines, potentially improving SEO.

7. Flexibility: Developers can choose which parts of a page to prerender and which to render dynamically, offering fine-grained control over the rendering process.

8. Experimental Status: As of Next.js 14, PPR is still in the experimental phase and may undergo changes in future releases.

PPR represents a significant step towards optimizing web applications for both performance and flexibility, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of both static and dynamic rendering within the same page.

<question>What are Server Actions in Next.js?</question>
<answer>
Server Actions, introduced in Next.js 13 and stabilized in Next.js 14, are a powerful feature that allows developers to define and execute server-side logic directly within React components. Here are the key aspects of Server Actions:

1. Server-Side Logic: They enable you to write server-side code that can be triggered from the client side, bridging the gap between client and server.

2. Form Handling: Server Actions simplify form submissions by allowing you to define the submission logic on the server, reducing the need for separate API routes.

3. Data Mutations: They provide a straightforward way to perform data mutations (create, update, delete operations) on the server.

4. Progressive Enhancement: Server Actions work without JavaScript, ensuring functionality even when JS is disabled or fails to load.

5. Type Safety: They offer end-to-end type safety when used with TypeScript, improving code reliability.

6. Optimistic Updates: Server Actions support optimistic updates, allowing UIs to update immediately before the server response, enhancing perceived performance.

7. Revalidation: They can be used to revalidate cached data, ensuring your application always shows the most up-to-date information.

8. Security: By keeping sensitive operations on the server, Server Actions help improve the security of your application.

9. Seamless Integration: They work well with other Next.js features like the App Router and React Server Components.

Server Actions represent a significant shift in how server-side logic is integrated into React applications, offering a more intuitive and efficient development experience.
